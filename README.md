### Key Performance Highlights

- **Overall Accuracy**: 81% across all classes
- **Best Performing Categories**:
  - Normal (F1: 1.00)
  - Myopia (F1: 0.95)
  - Cataract (F1: 0.93)
  - AMD (F1: 0.88)
- **Challenges**:
  - 'Other' category (F1: 0.00)
  - Hypertension (Precision: 0.40)

### Performance Analysis

1. **Strong Performance**:

   - Perfect classification for Normal cases
   - Excellent detection of Myopia and Cataract
   - High recall across most categories

2. **Areas for Improvement**:

   - Poor performance in 'Other' category
   - Low precision in Hypertension detection
   - Moderate precision in Diabetes classification

3. **Class Imbalance**:
   - Large variation in support sizes (8 to 210 samples)
   - May affect model performance on minority classes

### Model Metrics Summary

- Macro Average F1-Score: 0.74
- Weighted Average F1-Score: 0.76
- Overall Accuracy: 0.81

This performance analysis suggests strong potential for clinical application while highlighting specific areas for future improvement, particularly in handling the 'Other' category and improving precision for Hypertension detection.

## Model Visualization and Analysis

### 1. Distribution of Fundus Conditions

![Fundus Distribution](./graphs/fundus_distribution.png)

Distribution of eye conditions across the dataset:

- Both Abnormal: 45.7% of cases
- Both Normal: 30.0% of cases
- Left Normal, Right Abnormal: 12.9%
- Right Normal, Left Abnormal: 11.4%

This indicates a significant presence of bilateral conditions in the dataset.

### 2. Disease Cluster Analysis

![Disease Clusters](./graphs/disease_cluster.png)

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) visualization shows the relationship between different eye conditions:

- Clear separation between Normal (N) and Diabetic (D) cases
- Glaucoma (G) shows distinct clustering
- Age-related conditions (A) and Normal cases show some overlap
- Patient Age is centrally positioned, indicating its relevance across conditions

### 3. Confusion Matrix

![Confusion Matrix](./graphs/confusion_matrix.png)

The confusion matrix demonstrates the model's classification performance across different eye conditions:

- Perfect prediction (210/210) for Normal class
- Strong performance for Diabetes (181 correct predictions)
- Excellent accuracy for specialized conditions (Cataract: 35/35, Myopia: 28/28)
- Some misclassifications between Diabetes and Other categories

### 4. Model Training Performance

![Model Performance](./graphs//model_accuracy_loss.png)

Training metrics over epochs show:

- **Accuracy**:

  - Validation accuracy reaches ~80%
  - Training accuracy stabilizes around 65%
  - Good convergence without significant overfitting

- **Loss**:
  - Both training and validation loss decrease steadily
  - Model shows stable learning with minor fluctuations
  - Optimal convergence achieved around epoch 15

These visualizations demonstrate:

1. Strong classification performance across major disease categories
2. Clear disease clustering patterns
3. Balanced distribution of normal and abnormal cases
4. Stable and effective model training process
